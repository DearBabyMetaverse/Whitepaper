# DAO

{% hint style="info" %}
Motto: "You can not sell the cow and drink the milk."
{% endhint %}

When Dear Baby Metaverse infrastructure is established, a DAO organization will be formed to vote for resolutions. DAO members will work towards a common goal at the same time, and will be rewarded with rich $DBT tokens. By pledging $DBT tokens, you can join the DAO. Every time a proposal needs to be voted on, the 99 members with the highest current asset value will automatically have the right to vote and vote within a certain period of time. After the DAO is established in the future, this voting mechanism can be changed. In addition, there will also be related channels established in Discord for members to discuss freely.
