> Dear Baby Metaverse aims to build a good virtual platform for content sharing. It is a decentralized social and learning platform. Both learners and sharers can earn knowledge and income reward on this platform, and realize “Learn to Earn”, “Share to Earn”. The scarcity of planetary territories can also create more attention from businesses partners and users, and promote a better economic environment. DBT tokens can be used to purchase digital goods and services in the virtual world and obtain interest rate rewards through staking methods, which can be traded on virtual currency exchanges. The world is managed by the DAO organization, and anyone can become a member of the DAO, share the same goal for a better future, realize a decentralized virtual world, a brand new world, and grow up together from Baby.
