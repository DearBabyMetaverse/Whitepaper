# Background

{% hint style="info" %}
**Motto:** "Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything one has learned in school."

Dear Baby Metaverse is more than a virtual world. It is a decentralized infrastructure ecosystem that support the content sharing over the world. This is the world where real and virtual are connected. Here, you could go anywhere, see anything, do anything, learn and socialize with friends without boundaries. This is where you can create your own world without limitation.

Conventional learning path from schools is no longer the best fit system for this new century as schools have become commodified. The industrial model of school also commodify children by providing all the same standardized curriculum and determine their value with quality assurance score called grades. All commodities will reach the decline phase and eventually replaced.

What happen if children no longer need to sit in the classroom and listening to the teacher to feed whatever standard information planned for everyone. What happen when a learner has the option to meet up anytime, anywhere immediately with other learners just as interested in biodiversity in Amazon rainforest and do research together even they are from different continents. What happen when an adult can collaborate a charity project or social enterprise across the world by contribute and interact directly without a physical classroom?

“Learn outside the box; learn without boundaries!” It is the objective of this Dear Baby project to give schooling a new life-cycle by providing unconventional learning path to develop individual interests of learners and craft their ways to achieve their life goals with community resources over the world without boundaries.
