# For Token Stakeholders

{% hint style="info" %}
**Motto:** "I close my eyes to old ends and open my heart to new beginnings."
{% endhint %}

Token Stakeholders support the development of the platform by staking $DBT to obtain annual percentage rate(APR) rewards, which are divided into floating interest rate and fixed interest rate. The fixed interest rate requires users to lock more than 6 months to obtain higher returns. The interest rate will be determined according to the development of the platform at the time, and it will generally be higher than that of other exchange tokens.
