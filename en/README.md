{% endhint %}

Dear Baby Metaverse is a decentralized social and learning virtual platform based on the Solana blockchain, which will be managed by the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). On this platform, users not only limited to basic communications and interactions. They can create informative or skillset content through our creation tools in Studio and publish it for gaining tokens with accumulative view counts as reward. At the same time, users can also act as learners and gain tokens by completing certain level of learning progress. This is aimed to provide encouragement to both creators and learners as a win-win solution.

Planets in the Dear Baby Metaverse are non-fungible, transferable and rare digital assets stored in Solana smart contracts. They can be purchased with tokens issued by Dear Baby called $DBT. $DBT can be used to purchase digital goods and services in the metaverse, or gain token interest rewards through staking in the virtual currency exchanges.&#x20;

Nowadays, people spend most of their time interacting virtually including applications, websites, online classes, games, social media, etc. More and more companies have kick started digital transformation, moving their business from offline to online. It is the trend migrating towards our future, and education will be part of this megatrend.&#x20;
