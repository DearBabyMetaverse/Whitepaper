# Advertising

{% hint style="info" %}
**Motto:** "You canâ€™t live your life to please others. The choice must be yours."
{% endhint %}

Brands can use billboards near or inside high-traffic lots in the Planet to advertise their products, services, and events. Some neighborhoods may become the virtual versions of Times Square in New York City. Additionally, brands can position products and create shared experiences to engage with their audiences.
